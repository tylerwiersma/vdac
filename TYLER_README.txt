Voice Deactivated Alarm Clock
Tyler Wiersma

To install:

Install it from android studio, open it, allow microphone, and it'll be ready to go.

Buggy features:

The decativation works by voice, but only if its the first word or phrase it hears.
Was unsure how to make it so that you could EITHER press the screen OR deactivate it through voice.
Needs internet for speech to text
